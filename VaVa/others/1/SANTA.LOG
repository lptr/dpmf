During beta testing for the Santa Door callers were asked to pretend they had
their son or daughter with them when they came to see Santa.  Some did that
but some didn't, preferring to have fun with the script and trip it up.  The
results were sometimes hilarious.  Here are some samples from the Log.

===========================================================================
                                SCOTT J
Santa: Scott!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Scott: No, I have the child from hell with me.
Santa: Are you holding something back, like a name or description?
Scott: He's three years old, has green hair and incandescent red eyes.
Santa: I nearly got that.  Try another sentence construction.
Scott: Come come elucidate your thoughts. :)
Santa: Is there a future for Santa as a stand-up comic?
Scott: Not unless someone digitizes the Improv.
Santa: Tell me about it.
Scott: What a lively Eliza-clone you've got here, Rey.
Santa: Eliza!  Why that's Ms Claus first name.
Scott: Thought so.
Scott: Can Damien have a satanic doll for Christmas?
Santa: If there's one thing Santa knows about, that's it.  :)
Scott: Later, Santa
Santa: Is there another way to describe that?
Scott: Bye, get lost, hose off, blow, leave, exit.
Santa: Nice chatting with you, Scott.

                                  ANNA
Santa: Anna!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Anna: No indeed, Mr. Claus!  I have little Isvestia here with me.
Santa: Tell Santa about it.
Anna: Ah, I see Santa too has a problem with gender identification.  I was
hoping you could help there.
Santa: Another try might produce the result you want.

===========================================================================
                                MITCHELL
Santa: Mitchell!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Mitchell: Perhaps you're drunk, Santa.  I am quite alone
Santa: Only perhaps?  Ok....
Mitchell: Where's my present?
Santa: A wonderful expectation every year around this time.
Mitchell: Look, I'm not kidding!  Fork it over!
Santa: What?  I speak every language but there are some words I don't
Santa: understand.  Can you word that a different way?
Mitchell: Give me my toys, or you DIE you bloated old drunk!
Santa: Ho! Santa will have his hands full this year.
Mitchell: Bring friends!
Santa: Every year Santa brings more toys than King Wendy McBurger sells
Santa: hamburgers.
Mitchell: I want my present NOW!
Santa: That's what Santa is all about -- the spirit of giving.
Mitchell: So DO IT ALREADY!
Santa: Is there another way to describe that?
Mitchell: I'll see you tomorrow morning at the mall.  I want the whole BAG!
Santa: Santa can probably handle that.
Mitchell: You'd better, or ELSE!
Santa: Nice chatting with you, Mitchell.

===========================================================================
                                  JANE
Santa: Jane!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Jane: No, I have my cat and my dog here.
Santa: Tell me more.
Jane: I want a doll for Christmas.
Santa: We're well-stocked with good ones.
Jane: what kind of dolls do you have?
Santa: If there's one thing Santa knows about, that's it.  :)
Jane: I want one of those new dolls that sits on a potty and tinkles yellow
liquid.
Santa: Ho! Santa will have his hands full this year.
Jane: I want a train set, too.
Santa: Santa can probably handle that.
Jane: What toy can you get for my baby brother?
Santa: A Santa Specialty.

                                SCOTT F
Santa: Scott!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Scott: No, my wife is here with me
Santa: Are you holding something back, like a name or description?
Scott: Her name is Wendy
Scott: What we really want to know is how much loot we're getting for Christmas
Santa: I've been hearing that a lot this year.
Scott: we want cash
Santa: You're singing my song when you say that.
Scott: How is Mrs. Claus?
Santa: Earlier today Eliza finished a sonata she's been working on all year.
Santa: She doesn't want anything known about that yet, though.  What brings
Santa: you here this evening?

===========================================================================
                                 SHAWN
Santa: Shawn!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Shawn: No, I have a product of zygogeny with me.
Santa: Are you holding something back, like a name or description?
Shawn: Perhaps.  Say he's a genetic agregate of his mother and I, which means
he's half arrogant butthead and half decent human being.  We'll call him, ...
hmm... Worf.
Santa: I KNOW you.  We've talked before.  I've been to your house!
Shawn: So you have.  I think I pumped several 0.22LR shells in your direction. 
Shawn: Worf wants to know if you'll bring him the latest Romulan
disruptor for Christmas.
Santa: You put a twinkle in my eye with that.
Shawn: I never thought a weapon of mass destruction would twinkle Santa's eye, 
but perhaps you're Reagan Claus instead.
Santa: Only perhaps?
Shawn: Only perhaps.  You do seem to have a basic grasp of what you are saying.
Santa: Nice chatting with you, Shawn.

===========================================================================
                                  JEFF
Santa: Jeff!  Welcome to Santa's computer room.  Come right in.
Santa: I see you're not alone...
Jeff: yeah I have my kid
Santa: You have the spirit of Santa with you.
Jeff: Do you mean the spirit of a fat, drunken shit?
Santa: The elves will probably tie a bow on that.  Even shit can
Santa: be improved with a ribbon and bow.
Jeff: That's what I figured

If you get any choice exchanges between callers and Santa please send us a
copy. No one laughs more than the programmer when he sees what can happen
with the carefully crafted responses to key words.  Next year maybe YOUR
caller will find himself included in a sample file of Santa being led astray.

Santa: Try using different words. You're beyond my English vocabulary.

Santa: off my chest.'
Change: fuck
