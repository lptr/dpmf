
MAINTAIN is a utility to convert older versions of the SHAMpage data file and
maintain your new SHAMPAGE.DAT once it has been updated, keeping it in the
correct format. It will read your SHAMpage data file, sort it, renumber your
key words (so you know when you approach the limit of 100 words) and write a
new one. Duplicate key words and replies are easier to spot when they are
sorted. It will leave your old data file intact with the extension OLD.

   CAUTION! When you modify the data file, please remember that each KEY   
   WORD, including NOMATCH, is limited to a maximum of ten (10) replies.   
   Also, be absolutely certain you match the format of the example file.   
   Any variation will result in unpredictable and undesirable results. I   
   strongly recommend you run MAINTAIN every time you edit your data file. 
   It will check your data file for grievous errors and, while it will     
   catch some obvious errors in the file, it is not intended to replace    
   your own care in editing!

The syntax is: MAINTAIN [FileName] (defaults to SHAMPAGE.DAT).

If you are updating SHAMpage from a version older than v3.05 and wish to use
your old SHAMPAGE.DAT file you MUST convert it to the latest format with this
utility!

  Revised MAINTAIN.EXE. It now auto-detects if it's working on an old format
  data file or one which has already been converted. One less decision for
  all you harried SysOps! More kinds of errors are now detected and last, but
  not least, it is so much prettier! <grin>.
