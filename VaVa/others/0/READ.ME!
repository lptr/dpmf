If you haven't read WHAT'S.NEW lately, please do so. There have been many
additions, including new variables and new command-line options. If you've
just overwritten the EXE without reading the docs, SHAMpage will work fine,
but you may be missing out on some of its best features!

NOTO BENE!

If you're upgrading from a version of SHAmpage prior to v3.05, the format of
SHAMPAGE.DAT has changed! If you want to use your old data file, you MUST
convert it with the maintain utility! See the docs for more information.
